# Music store app

The aim of this assignment is to get a feeling how you approach requirements and come up with a technical solution and structure for them.

Create a music store app using React.

Your goal is to display top 100 albums in a searchable list. Albums should have a detail view (e.g. can look at details of an album). Client side routing is desirable, but not required.

## Requirements:

- Use React.
- Use Typescript.
- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json
- Have client-side search of albums.

## Notes:

- You can use `create-react-app` and such.
- You can use your preferred way to style your application. You can use a CSS framework.

## Preferences:

At Userlike, we use the following libraries. It's preferable if you use some of them. But if it doesn't make sense, don't force yourself to use them:

- redux
- rxjs
- fp-ts & io-ts
